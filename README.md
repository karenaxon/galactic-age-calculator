# Galactic Age Calculator
A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. For instance, a solar year on Mercury lasts 88 days. This application takes a user's age in years and returns her/his age in Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter years. In addition, the user will be informed of how many years she/he has left to live based on the life expectancy for each planet.
